          <p>We are students in the cybersecurity program at the Davis Catalyst Center, where we explore ethical hacking and learn how to secure programs, services, and servers against potential threats. 
          This password checker started as a somewhat spontaneous group project to help people better protect themselves by strengthening one of the most commonly used security measures online.</p>

            <p>Hey, I was the one who had the idea for this project, but it has expanded much more than I originally thought it would, which is amazing.
              Making this has taught me quite a bit, and has been really fun.<br><br>
              I'm currently at Syracuse High School as a senior. I am an aspiring cybersecurity and IT professional, and I like learning more about anything computer related. I'm still learning so I'm not that knowledgeable yet but I try my best. In my personal time, I love to play video games or hang out with my friends.
