        <p>We are students in the cybersecurity program at the Davis Catalyst Center, where we explore ethical hacking and learn how to secure programs, services, and servers against potential threats. 
        This password checker started as a somewhat spontaneous group project to help people better protect themselves by strengthening one of the most commonly used security measures online.</p>

          <h1>Ashton Chronister</h1>
          <p>My name is Ashton and I was the one who had the idea for this project.
            I helped format the HTML, designed much of the CSS of the main page, and some other things here and there.<br><br>
            I'm currently at Syracuse High School as a senior. I am an aspiring Cybersecurity and IT professional wanting to learn more about really anything computer related. I's still learning so I'm not that knowledgeable yet but I try my best. I love to play video games with my friends and just talk over discord.
