        <h1>How it got started</h1>
        <p>
          This all started as a simple group project for a class at the Davis Catalyst Center.
          The first idea was a simple website password strength checker.
          But we all wanted to do more, and expanded the idea into a password manager.
          We made an app that can store passwords, as we have now. 
          It was a little rough around the edges, but was a great starting point.
          We upgraded the password manager, rebuild the website,
          bought a domain name, and started hosting it.
          And that leads us to today. We now have a great password manager that anyone can download.
