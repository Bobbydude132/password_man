          <p>
            This all started as a simple group project for a class at the Davis Catalyst Center.
            The first idea was a simple website password strength checker.
            But we all wanted to do more, and expanded the idea into a password manager.
            We made an app that can store passwords, as we have now. 
            It was a little rough around the edges, but was a great starting point.
            We upgraded the password manager, rebuild the website,
            bought a domain name, and started hosting it.
            And that leads us to today. We now have a great password manager that anyone can download.

          <h1>Core Features</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-section">
          <h3>Password Strength Checker</h3>
          <p>We analyze your passwords using a robust combination of a trusted password breach database and our own optimized rainbow table to detect weak or compromised passwords.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-section">
          <h3>Secure Password Storage</h3>
          <p>Store all your login information with peace of mind. Your data is protected with industry-grade encryption methods, including XOR/SHA-256 and Base64 encoding.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-section">
          <h3>Password & Passphrase Generator</h3>
          <p>Generate secure, memorable passphrases using EFF Dice encryption. Even with just 4 words, the odds of your passphrase being cracked are 1 in 120 billion — that's 37 bits of 
            entropy, roughly as hard as guessing the right grain of sand on a football field.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-section">
          <h3>Password Update Reminders</h3>
          <p>Keep your accounts secure with regular reminders to update old passwords.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-section">
          <h3>Autofill & Background Operation</h3>
          <p>Let us handle the hassle – your passwords autofill securely while we run in the background. *Evil laughter*</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-section">
          <h3>Multi-Factor Authentication</h3>
          <p>Add an extra layer of security to your login process with robust MFA options.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-section">
          <h3>SMS and SMTP Alerts</h3>
          <p>Stay informed with real-time alerts sent to your phone or email whenever suspicious activity is detected.</p>
        </div>
        
        
        
        <div class="section-heading">
          <h1>How We Keep You Safe</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-section">
          <h3>Efficient Encryption Algorithms</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>XOR + SHA-256 + Base64: A solid, logic-based encryption combo used in our open-source version to ensure long-term stability without relying on potentially unstable external libraries.</li>
            <li>AES-256 Encryption (Paid Version): We use the gold standard of encryption. AES-256 provides a staggering 2²⁵⁶ possibilities (that's 1.15e+77 keys) — more than atoms in the universe.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-section">
          <h3>Salt & Key Derivation</h3>
          <p>Every encryption uses a unique salt and derived key, so even identical passwords are stored differently.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-section">
          <h3>Master Password Protection</h3>
          <p>A strong master password makes your data virtually impenetrable. A 12-character password with mixed characters has over 4.6e+23 combinations — more than the grains of sand on Earth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-section">
          <h3>Virtually Impossible to Crack</h3>
          <p>With AES-256 and strong passwords, brute-force attacks become mathematically impractical. Even supercomputers would need billions of years to make a dent.</p>
        </div>
        
        
        <div class="section-heading">
          <h1>Open-Source & Future-Proof</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-section">
          <h3>Virtually Impossible to Crack</h3>
          <p>Our free, open-source version is built with simplicity and logic in mind, avoiding unstable third-party dependencies. It's designed to be stable and trustworthy for years to come.</p>
          <p>Prefer top-tier encryption? Our paid version includes AES-256, though no system is guaranteed to be future-proof forever.</p>
